![TrailBlazer.ai Machine Learning Training](/assets/images/deep_learning_training_classes.png){:class="img-responsive"}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**TrailBlazer.ai** brings to market unique and challenging corporate education products based around the Google [**TensorFlow 2.0**](https://tensorflow.org){:target="_blank"} machine learning framework. Our instructor-led deep learning classes are delivered as hands-on, scenario-based training exercises which are used to fully immerse class attendees in solving the real world obstacles they are likely to encounter in the machine learning sector of technology.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our machine learning training classes start with the building blocks of artificial intelligence and machine cognition theory, including refresher materials on the biological origins of today's artificial neural network topologies, a gentle introduction to the mathematics required for machine learning model development and training, a historical overview of the advent of deep learning technologies including a deep dive into both Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware acceleration platforms, a crash course on the Python programming language for the uninitiated, and an introduction to the field of optimization theory to better understand the hidden financial and technological pitfalls associated with large scale AI / ML model training and inference.

>Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life." --Mark Twain

### Training Options

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delivered in both standard four (4) day and five (5) day extended hours bootcamp formats, our instructor-led deep learning courses are designed around the concept that an enthusiatic layperson with no formal AI / ML experience, if taught properly, can get up to speed with the most recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence technology, using an easy to comprehend educational format and training modality that makes gratuitous use of hands on lab exercises to reinforce each module of instructor lecture.

#### Dedicated Classes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is complicated, but your corporate education missives don't have to be. Leave the guesswork to us and let TrailBlazer.ai handle the heavy lifting by providing your organization with a turnkey, onsite machine learning training package where our instructors come onsite to your location with everything needed to deliver one or more of our deep learning courses. Our corporate instructors have successfully delivered classes on every continent except Antarctica, but that can be arranged as well...
- We bring each class attendee a GTX1060-class laptop optimized for machine learning training and with more than sufficient GPU horsepower to tackle all lab exercises during the week of instruction
- More than 25 modules of instruction (four day format) or 30+ modules of instruction (five day bootcamp) are included with our machine learning courseware books given to each student
- Each module of instruction includes at least one (1) hands on lab exercise from our student lab manual, also included with our deep learning courseware kits

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Contact Us**](https://TrailBlazer.ai/contact_machine_learning_experts) today to learn more about running a dedicated TrailBlazer.ai machine learning course onsite at your corporate location.
